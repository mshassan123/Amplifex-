🔍 Key Capabilities
🧬 DNA Sequence Insights

Works with Raw & FASTA input

Calculates:

Base counts & percentages

GC content

Shannon entropy

Distributions and charts

🔎 Feature Detection

Amplifex automatically finds:
✔ Homopolymers
✔ Short tandem repeats
✔ Palindromes
✔ Low complexity regions

All features are:

Highlighted on the Sequence Map

Reported in a summary table

Visualized with clean charts

🧪 Smart Primer Design

Amplifex has a fully-featured primer design engine using:

SantaLucia nearest-neighbor thermodynamics

Tm optimization

Dimer & cross-dimer filtering

Adjustable design parameters

Result: High-quality primer pairs with accurate thermodynamic scoring.

🎛 Primer Physics Dashboard

Input any primer sequence to get:

Tm (Wallace & thermodynamic)

Molecular weight

Extinction coefficient

Self-dimer ΔG

Structure warnings + suitability tests

Great for validating primers before ordering.

📊 Beautiful, Interactive Visuals

Amplifex includes:

Canvas-based sequence maps with feature highlights

Interactive charts for base composition

GC gauges and distribution plots

Clean UI designed for ease of interpretation

🧠 How It Works (Under the Hood)

Sequence is parsed & analyzed client-side

Features are detected via rule-based scanning

Primer candidates are generated across the sequence

Thermodynamics calculated with SantaLucia model

Best primer pairs are filtered & ranked

Data shown with responsive UI and export options

_No server. No data uploads. Your data stays local.
